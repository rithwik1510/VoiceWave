# VoiceWave Shared Agent Rules

This is the persistent coordination file for all agents in this repository.
All agents must follow these rules before and during implementation.

## 1) Canonical References

- Product plan: `Idea.md`
- Visual baseline: `Frontend .png`
- Agent kickoff file: `AGENT_START.md`

## 2) Locked Product Decisions

1. Frontend stack in Tauri: React + Tailwind.
2. The provided prototype image is the official v1 visual baseline.
3. v1 is strict local-only (no cloud rewrite path in v1).
4. Battery target: <= 12% drain over 30 minutes active dictation (reference laptop).
5. Official v1 supported app matrix (top 10):
   - Chrome
   - Edge
   - Safari (macOS)
   - Google Docs (browser)
   - Slack (desktop/web)
   - Notion (desktop/web)
   - VS Code
   - Cursor
   - Notepad (Windows)
   - Notes (macOS)
6. CI platform baseline: GitHub Actions.
7. ADR format baseline: Nygard ADR format.
8. Phase 0 benchmark peers: Wispr Flow, Raycast, Superwhisper, MacWhisper.
9. Temporary platform execution override (effective 2026-02-10): implement and validate on Windows only unless the user explicitly re-enables macOS work.

## 3) Phase Discipline

1. Work must follow the phase gates in `Idea.md`.
2. Do not implement future-phase scope unless explicitly reassigned.
3. Each agent must clearly tag their work with phase context in commit/notes.
4. Parallel phase work is allowed, but every agent must preserve shared contracts (locked decisions, state model, local-only policy).
5. If new files appear from another active phase, do not revert them; integrate them through docs, CI, and interface checks.
6. If `AGENT_START.md` assignment conflicts with an explicit user reassignment in-session, follow the user's latest explicit assignment and log the change in `Mistake Log`.
7. While the Windows-only execution override is active, do not spend implementation or test cycles on macOS tasks.

## 4) UI and UX Guardrails

1. Match prototype structure and information hierarchy unless a documented exception is added.
2. Keep state visibility deterministic: idle, listening, transcribing, inserted, error.
3. Never introduce UI behavior that conflicts with local-only privacy posture.

## 5) Quality and Safety Rules

1. Reliability and insertion correctness are prioritized over feature count.
2. Permission flows must have denial recovery and fallback UX.
3. Any architecture-impacting change requires a short decision entry in this file.
4. Any UI-core command/event contract rename or payload change must be reflected in RFC/ADR docs in the same work cycle.
5. When Rust core modules are present in Phase I+, CI must include Rust compile/test checks (or an explicit temporary waiver in phase notes).
6. Any web-mode demo state simulation must support cancellation and include a unit test for cancellation behavior.
7. Any substantial frontend refactor in an active phase must add or update tests for critical state transitions and primary controls.
8. If multiple prototype code trees exist, the authoritative implementation path must be documented and non-authoritative copies must be archived or explicitly excluded.
9. `voicewave-prototype/` is an approved frontend reference artifact already used in Phase I; treat it as frontend-only source material and do not open/use it for non-frontend work.
10. `voicewave-prototype/` is non-runtime and non-release scope; do not wire its cloud/API-key patterns into active v1 runtime paths unless explicitly reassigned by the user.
11. Phase I validation must include at least one desktop-feature compile path (`--features desktop` or default features), not only `--no-default-features`.
12. Phase battery/thermal evidence is signoff-valid only when capture duration is at least 30.0 minutes with explicit hardware context.
13. Development scripts and build steps must support workspace paths containing spaces on Windows.
14. Dictation cancellation must interrupt active microphone capture loops promptly, not only post-capture inference stages.
11. Rust toolchain invocation must be documented for Windows shells where PATH is stale; fallback command is `C:\Users\posan\.cargo\bin\cargo.exe`.
12. If MSVC linker setup is unavailable, GNU toolchain fallback may be used for compile diagnostics (`cargo +stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu ...`) with LLVM-MinGW on PATH.
13. Any toolchain-run failure must log whether the blocker is environment setup or project code, with exact file/line references when code is at fault.
14. Any new Phase II+ command surface must pass at least one desktop-feature compile path and one unit-test path before handoff notes are published.
15. Any change that touches `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` command wiring must keep `src-tauri/src/state.rs` present and compiling in the same work cycle.
16. Any new Phase III command surface must include matching frontend bridge/types wiring and at least one UI smoke test in the same work cycle.
17. Phase III cannot be marked complete unless signed manifest verification, resumable installer behavior, tamper quarantine path, required security/reliability tests, and history encryption (or documented ADR deferment) are all delivered with evidence artifacts.
17. Any Phase II hotkey completion claim must include OS-level global registration evidence (or be explicitly labeled app-scoped fallback) plus at least one validation artifact.
18. Any Phase III model-manager handoff claim must include signed-manifest fields, interrupted-download resume behavior, and a cancellation/recovery test artifact in the same cycle.
19. Any persistence layer that stores transcript/history content must either encrypt at rest when retention is enabled or include an ADR-documented deferment with risk acceptance.
20. When phase completion status changes (for example, Phase II/III done), `README.md` and phase status summaries must be updated in the same work cycle.
21. No phase may be marked complete when its core runtime dependency is still mock-only (for ASR phases, this means real whisper.cpp decode path evidence is required).
22. Windows GNU whisper.cpp builds must use bindgen-compatible `libclang` setup and verbatim static library linking (`ggml.a` / `ggml-base.a` / `ggml-cpu.a`) before Phase II/III handoff evidence is published.
23. Windows developer run scripts (`tauri:dev` / `tauri:build`) must enforce GNU toolchain fallback when MSVC linker is unavailable and must use a no-space workspace path strategy.
24. Windows GNU run scripts must prioritize a GCC-based MinGW toolchain path (WinLibs) ahead of LLVM-MinGW clang wrappers, and Vite dev configuration must pin `optimizeDeps.entries` to the authoritative app entrypoint when parallel prototype trees exist.
25. Installed model index must be reconciled against on-disk artifacts at startup; missing or size-mismatched model files must be pruned before runtime use.
26. Invalid hotkey settings must never crash startup; fall back to default hotkeys and persist a valid config.
27. Any phase-status or validation-pass claim in `README.md` / phase docs must be backed by same-cycle command output from the current branch; stale pass claims must be corrected immediately.
28. Windows Rust compile/test instructions must use a no-space workspace strategy (wrapper script or temporary junction) when the repo path contains spaces; raw space-path commands are diagnostic-only and must be labeled as such.
29. ASR quality signoff cannot rely only on fixture/scripted transcript harnesses; each active ASR phase must include at least one real microphone + whisper.cpp quality artifact.
30. Transcript text must strip or quarantine non-user special tokens (example: `[BLANK_AUDIO]`) before insertion/history/dictionary ingestion unless explicitly surfaced as diagnostics.
31. Runtime must warn when the selected microphone path is likely low-quality for ASR (for example Bluetooth hands-free profiles) and offer an in-app device-switch recovery path.
32. `docs/PHASE1_IMPLEMENTATION.md` and `docs/PHASE3_IMPLEMENTATION.md` must be reconciled in the same cycle whenever runtime decode status or validation evidence changes.
33. Home-screen mic start must not hard-fail on first-run model mismatch; runtime must auto-select an installed model or bootstrap `tiny.en` with explicit status feedback.
34. Home-screen mic control semantics are press-and-hold by default: release must transition to finish/transcribe flow, and short/empty captures must not raise hard error state.
35. Insertion fallback outcomes (`historyFallback` / clipboard-only preserve) must be surfaced as non-fatal state feedback, not promoted to global error state.
36. Transcript streaming must emit cumulative partial text across capture segments and publish exactly one utterance-level final event to avoid last-segment overwrite behavior.
37. When phase status is rebaselined, `docs/PHASE_RECOVERY_PLAN.md` and any phase implementation doc with contradictory status claims must be updated in the same cycle.
38. Readiness/validation automation must not hardcode date-stamped artifact filenames when rolling artifacts are expected; scripts must resolve the latest matching artifact pattern.
39. Readiness pass/fail parsers must anchor to structured checklist rows (not freeform prose) to avoid false positives from instructional text.
40. If a hard quality gate is temporarily deferred (example: sustained battery run), the deferment must include a `Status: Complete` marker file, explicit target phase for closure, and matching readiness-script logic in the same cycle.
41. Manual acceptance templates must keep pass/fail markers as raw checklist tokens (`[x] pass / [ ] fail`) and must not wrap them in code formatting that breaks gate parsers.
42. When `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` sets `"bundle.active": true`, `bundle.icon` must include a valid Windows `.ico` path and at least one `tauri:build` verification run must be recorded in the same cycle.
43. Push-to-talk microphone capture must not auto-transition to transcribing from silence timeout after speech is detected; transcription starts only on explicit release/stop (or max utterance cap).
44. Global hotkey runtime polling must never await long-running dictation flows inline; hotkey actions must be dispatched asynchronously so press/release edges continue to process during active capture.
45. Frontend must suppress browser-default key handling for configured dictation hotkey combos (example: `Ctrl+Alt+Space`) in non-editable contexts to prevent in-app scroll/focus jumps during push-to-talk.
46. Any asynchronously dispatched push-to-talk `pressed` action must re-check current key-down state before starting dictation so stale `pressed` tasks cannot start a new session after release.
47. When extending telemetry payload structs, avoid `Copy` derives on heap-backed fields (for example `String`) and run desktop-feature validation in the same cycle before claiming readiness.
48. Any newly added PowerShell gate/readiness script must be executed at least once in the same cycle to catch syntax/runtime errors before handoff.
49. For async tasks in desktop runtime code, use a single runtime `JoinHandle` type per flow (`tokio::task::JoinHandle` or `tauri::async_runtime::JoinHandle`) and avoid methods not supported by that handle type (for example `is_finished` on Tauri handles).
50. Model benchmark/recommendation defaults must operate on currently installed model artifacts (not full catalog) and any auto-activation path must only apply recommendations that are installed.
51. Settings persistence/parsing must tolerate UTF-8 BOM and blank/whitespace-only JSON files to prevent startup crashes from shell/editor encoding defaults.
52. Windows CUDA feature auto-enable in Tauri wrapper scripts must verify toolchain readiness (`cl.exe` presence) and fall back to CPU unless CUDA is explicitly forced with a valid environment.
53. Floating desktop HUD/pill windows must use DPI-aware monitor work-area positioning (scale-factor adjusted) and be re-positioned on show to keep true bottom-center placement on Windows multi-monitor/scaled displays.
54. Floating HUD/pill visual state must react to push-to-talk hotkey `pressed`/`released` events immediately (not only dictation state events) to avoid perceived non-responsiveness.
55. Tauri runtime detection helpers used by secondary webviews (for example floating pill windows) must include Tauri v2 protocol/global fallbacks (`asset:` / `__TAURI_IPC__` / user-agent) so event/invoke bridges do not silently disable.
56. Floating pill inner visuals (wave + loading spinner) must be center-layered in all states; state transitions must not rely on horizontal flow layout that can shift content right/left.
57. Default global hotkeys must avoid high-collision OS/app combos (notably `Alt+Space` patterns); when legacy defaults are detected at load time, migrate to a safer non-conflicting pair.
58. High-frequency runtime telemetry streams (for example mic-level events) must be throttled/debounced before updating top-level React state to prevent whole-app flicker during dictation.
59. Mic-level monitoring must not run continuously while idle; it should only be active during explicit dictation/diagnostic capture windows to avoid Bluetooth headset call-mode/OS audio ducking side effects.
60. Browser/contenteditable insertion targets (including Google AI Studio/Gemini-style editors) must prefer clipboard-paste over direct key injection, and clipboard restoration timing must allow paste completion to avoid stale or mutated inserted text.
61. Global hotkey polling for modifier-only push-to-talk combos must debounce key-state edges (multi-sample confirmation, with release confirmation >= ~150ms) and release only after required-modifier guard keys are truly up, so transient Windows key sampling jitter cannot emit immediate press-then-release cycles.
62. Push-to-talk `released` handling must only stop dictation sessions that were started by push-to-talk; manual mic-button sessions must be isolated from hotkey-release events.
63. Hold-to-talk UI buttons must use pointer capture for press lifecycle and must not rely on `pointerleave` as the primary release signal, to avoid false stop edges during animation/layout changes.
64. Dictation start sequencing must claim/validate the active cancellation token before mutating `active_session`; rejected duplicate starts must never overwrite session ownership metadata.
65. Normal dictation flow must avoid opening parallel microphone input streams (for example capture + separate level monitor on the same device) and should derive level telemetry from the active capture stream where possible.
66. Microphone capture loops must debounce early stop signals (for example first ~200ms after stream start) so transient release jitter cannot terminate newly-started sessions before speech capture begins.
67. Any ASR speed-tuning or decode-profile change must include same-cycle quality guard tests (confidence/retry heuristics + transcript sanitizer/formatter checks) and these tests must be executed by at least one phase validation script before handoff.
68. Faster-Whisper microphone decode paths must preserve contiguous speech capture (or an equivalent validated strategy) and must not depend only on strict pre-decode VAD segmentation; include at least one unit test that proves low-energy speech is retained under strict VAD thresholds.
69. Rust event-emission callsites that send owned payloads and continue using them in-scope must avoid move-after-use regressions (clone/borrow as needed) and be covered by same-cycle desktop-feature compile validation.
70. Latency telemetry stage timers must use non-overlapping boundaries (`decode_ms`, `post_ms`, `insert_ms`, `release_to_final_ms`, `release_to_inserted_ms`); `post_ms` must exclude insertion time, and any decode-policy signal derived from these fields must be validated in the same cycle against real diagnostic records.
71. Diagnostics/readiness outputs that report `success` from runtime records must label it as pipeline/insertion success (not transcript accuracy) unless paired with an explicit ASR-quality metric.
72. Transcript post-processing paths that branch on owned `String` values must preserve metric inputs for later telemetry computation (borrow/clone before move) and pass desktop-feature compile validation in the same cycle.
73. Windows hotkey cue feedback must use app-owned cue assets (not OS default beep semantics or browser-audio-only paths) and must pass one desktop-feature compile validation in the same cycle.
74. Frontend tests for popup/modal surfaces must scope assertions to the active dialog (role/name or `within(dialog)`) rather than global text queries when nav labels and dialog titles can share the same wording.
75. UI motion refinements requested as directional entrance effects must avoid overshoot/jitter unless explicitly requested; prefer a single smooth trajectory and confirm the perceived feel with the user.
76. When brand gradient is requested for floating pill visuals, keep gradient treatment outside the pill shell (aura/ring) unless explicitly asked for interior tint; preserve black interior/surface readability and avoid hard-edged glow artifacts.
77. Faster-Whisper auto-GPU policy must fail safe: if CUDA decode falls back at runtime, persist a CPU-preferred marker for subsequent sessions (unless GPU is explicitly forced) so users do not repeatedly pay long failed-GPU attempts on first utterances.
78. GPU readiness gates must validate runtime DLL compatibility for the active inference stack (not just toolkit/link libs); for Faster-Whisper/CTranslate2 on Windows this includes `cublas64_12.dll` availability before claiming CUDA-ready.
79. GPU readiness checks must resolve runtime DLLs from both system CUDA paths and project-scoped Python NVIDIA runtime wheels (for example `.venv-faster-whisper\Lib\site-packages\nvidia\*\bin`) so package-based CUDA setups are reported correctly.

- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: I | Issue: `AGENT_START.md` still listed this agent as Phase 0-only while user explicitly reassigned this session to Phase I. | Impact: Assignment ambiguity and potential blocked execution. | Fix applied: Proceeded with explicit user reassignment and recorded override rule in Phase Discipline. | Prevention rule added: User reassignment overrides kickoff assignment when conflicts exist.
- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: I Review | Issue: Phase I Rust runtime modules exist, but CI currently validates only frontend tests/build and skips Rust compile/test jobs. | Impact: Core audio/inference regressions can pass CI undetected. | Fix applied: Logged integration gap during review and added explicit CI prevention rule. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 5.
- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: I Review | Issue: Implemented Tauri command/event names diverged from Phase 0 RFC interface contract without companion ADR/RFC update. | Impact: Cross-agent contract drift risk between docs and runtime integration. | Fix applied: Logged contract drift during review and added documentation-sync prevention rule. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 4.
- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: I Review | Issue: Web fallback demo flow in `useVoiceWave` schedules uncancelled timers, allowing state to transition after user presses Cancel. | Impact: Incorrect state feedback and flaky demo behavior outside Tauri runtime. | Fix applied: Logged behavior risk during review and added cancellation-test prevention rule. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 6.
- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: I Closeout | Issue: Phase I runtime command/event contract drifted from RFC and remained unsynced while implementation evolved. | Impact: Integration ambiguity across UI/core and parallel agents. | Fix applied: Standardized on `start_dictation(mode)` + `cancel_dictation`, added state payload message support, and updated RFC + implementation notes in same cycle. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 4.
- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: I Review | Issue: Large Phase I UI refactor landed with only `stateLabel` unit tests and no component/hook interaction coverage for record toggling and state display. | Impact: Higher risk of undetected UI behavior regressions. | Fix applied: Logged coverage gap and added frontend-refactor testing rule. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 7.
- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: I Review | Issue: Parallel prototype code trees now exist (`src/prototype` and `voicewave-prototype`) without explicit authority documentation. | Impact: Drift/confusion risk for future agents and reviewers. | Fix applied: Logged source-of-truth risk and added prototype-authority rule. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 8.
- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: I Review | Issue: `voicewave-prototype` contains cloud AI dependency wiring (`@google/genai`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`) while v1 policy is strict local-only. | Impact: Initially flagged as policy drift risk. | Fix applied: Superseded by user clarification that this directory is an intentional Gemini-exported frontend prototype and non-runtime reference. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rules 9 and 10.
- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: I Review | Issue: Prior review treated `voicewave-prototype` as a direct project risk without user context that it is an intentional Gemini-exported frontend prototype. | Impact: Could create unnecessary cleanup or review noise. | Fix applied: Reclassified `voicewave-prototype` as approved frontend-only reference material used by Phase I; constrained usage for non-frontend tasks. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rules 9 and 10.
- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: I Review | Issue: Rust validation paths (`CI` + local script) rely on `--no-default-features`, which skips desktop-gated runtime code in `src-tauri/src/state.rs` and command wiring in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`. | Impact: Desktop runtime regressions can slip through while tests stay green. | Fix applied: Logged coverage gap and added desktop-feature compile requirement. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 11.
- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: I Review | Issue: Current battery report (`docs/phase1/phase1-battery-thermal-windows.json`) shows only ~1.01 minutes duration, below the 30-minute gate target. | Impact: Phase I battery gate evidence is incomplete for handoff confidence. | Fix applied: Logged evidence-quality requirement for phase signoff artifacts. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 12.
- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: I Review | Issue: Desktop-feature Rust compile failed in workspace path with spaces during review (`voice vibe`), with `windres` resource build path parsing failure. | Impact: Local developer workflow can fail despite no-default-features checks passing. | Fix applied: Logged Windows path-space compatibility requirement for build scripts. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 13.
- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: I Review | Issue: Microphone-mode capture runs in a blocking capture loop and cancellation currently takes effect only after capture returns, not during capture. | Impact: Stop action may appear immediate in UI while microphone capture thread can continue until timeout/silence conditions. | Fix applied: Logged cooperative-cancellation requirement for capture loops. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 14.
- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: I Tooling | Issue: `cargo` was unavailable in shell PATH and MSVC linker (`link.exe`) was missing for default host builds, blocking Rust test execution. | Impact: Rust validation initially failed as environment issue rather than code signal. | Fix applied: Verified rustup toolchain install, installed LLVM-MinGW fallback, and ran `cargo +stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu test` to reach code-level errors. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rules 11, 12, and 13.
- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: I Scope | Issue: Phase I docs still implied macOS validation work in the current execution cycle after user confirmed only Windows hardware is available. | Impact: Risk of wasted implementation/testing time on unavailable platform. | Fix applied: Added Windows-only execution override in planning/runtime docs and agent rules. | Prevention rule added: Locked Product Decision 9 and Phase Discipline rule 7.
- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: II | Issue: Initial Phase II runtime patch introduced compile blockers (`src-tauri/src/state.rs` async error mapping and `src-tauri/src/insertion/mod.rs` borrow conflict) before verification. | Impact: Desktop-feature Rust compile path failed until corrected. | Fix applied: Corrected error mapping to `ControllerError::Tauri`, resolved borrow conflict with staged transaction id, and re-ran GNU desktop compile + lib tests. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 14.
- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: II Stabilization | Issue: Parallel edits left `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` still referencing `state` while `src-tauri/src/state.rs` was missing, and Rust core had unresolved compile blockers (`sha2` dependency + dictionary mutable borrow). | Impact: Phase II runtime was non-compilable and unsafe for handoff. | Fix applied: Rebuilt `state.rs` controller/event wiring, restored compile integrity, added missing dependency, fixed borrow bug, and validated both no-default tests and desktop-feature compile path. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 15.
- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: III | Issue: Phase III backend command surface existed, but frontend tabs/bridge/types were not fully wired, leaving sidebar sections functionally static. | Impact: Users could see UI structure but could not operate model/history/dictionary controls end-to-end. | Fix applied: Wired Phase III commands into `src/lib/tauri.ts`, `src/types/voicewave.ts`, `src/hooks/useVoiceWave.ts`, and `src/App.tsx`, and added tab smoke tests. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 16.
- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: III Review | Issue: Phase III progress was reported too optimistically after UI/command wiring while critical security/reliability scope (signed manifest verification, resumable installer pipeline, tamper quarantine recovery, encryption-at-rest, and hardware-tier recommendation evidence) was still incomplete. | Impact: Handoff confidence was overstated and completion status was ambiguous. | Fix applied: Reclassified Phase III as incomplete, documented strict completion gate criteria in agent rules, and queued missing scope for implementation in current cycle. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 17.
- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: II+III Review | Issue: Runtime hotkey flow remains app-window scoped (`window` key listeners) while Phase II goals call for global hotkeys; core path does not yet provide verified OS-level registration behavior. | Impact: Dictation hotkeys may fail when VoiceWave is unfocused, reducing insertion reliability against gate intent. | Fix applied: Logged scope gap during integration review and added explicit global-hotkey evidence rule. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 17.
- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: III Review | Issue: Model manager currently installs deterministic local artifacts synchronously without signed manifest metadata, interrupted-download resume, or meaningful cancellation/recovery path. | Impact: Phase III model pipeline gates (signed manifest + resumable installer reliability) are only partially met. | Fix applied: Logged model-pipeline gate gap during integration review and added mandatory handoff evidence rule. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 18.
- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: III Review | Issue: Session history/settings persistence remains plain JSON files without encryption-at-rest for retained transcript content. | Impact: Diverges from architecture/privacy requirement for encrypted history when enabled. | Fix applied: Logged persistence-security gap during integration review and added encryption-or-ADR requirement. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 19.
- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: II+III Review | Issue: `README.md` still describes active implementation as Phase 1 stream and omits Phase III validation status/command in current repo state. | Impact: Onboarding and release-readiness visibility can drift from actual implementation state. | Fix applied: Logged documentation drift during integration review and added same-cycle status-update rule. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 20.
- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: I-III Rebaseline | Issue: Phase progress communication drifted from core plan by advancing phase claims while inference runtime still relied on mock decode output. | Impact: Misaligned expectations about whether whisper.cpp-backed dictation was actually complete. | Fix applied: Rebased master docs (`README.md`, `Idea.md`, phase docs) to whisper.cpp-first truth and added explicit recovery plan. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 21.
- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: I-III Toolchain | Issue: Windows GNU whisper.cpp build used generated bindings with enum-sign mismatch and CMake produced non-prefixed `ggml*.a` archives that were not linked by default, blocking desktop compile validation. | Impact: Rust desktop compile path failed despite inference/runtime implementation being present. | Fix applied: Installed LLVM `libclang`, switched to generated bindings via `.cargo/config.toml`, patched `vendor/whisper-rs` enum discriminant casts, and patched `vendor/whisper-rs-sys/build.rs` to emit verbatim static link directives and robust link-path discovery. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 22.
- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Dev Experience | Issue: `tauri dev` defaulted to MSVC host and failed on machines without `link.exe`, even though GNU toolchain fallback was already validated for this workspace. | Impact: Local run/build was blocked for contributors lacking Visual Studio Build Tools. | Fix applied: Added Windows Tauri wrapper scripts that enforce GNU toolchain, inject MinGW paths, and run from a no-space junction path; rewired `package.json` `tauri:dev` and `tauri:build` scripts. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 23.
- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Dev Experience Stabilization | Issue: Tauri dev wrappers still failed because LLVM-MinGW clang wrappers were taking precedence over WinLibs GCC (`-lgcc`/`-lgcc_eh` unresolved), and Vite dep scan attempted to index both root and `voicewave-prototype` HTML entries during beforeDev startup. | Impact: Local app startup remained unstable with repeated linker and dep-scan failures. | Fix applied: Forced WinLibs MinGW precedence in Tauri wrapper scripts and constrained Vite dependency entry scanning to `index.html` while ignoring `voicewave-prototype` watch paths. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 24.
- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: II/III Model Manager | Issue: Installed model index could list missing model files, causing dictation errors and phantom installs. | Impact: Dictation failed with missing model path while UI showed installed state. | Fix applied: Reconciled installed index against disk artifacts at startup and removed missing/size-mismatched entries; added runtime guard when resolving active model. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 25.
- 2026-02-10 | Agent: Codex | Phase: II/III Hotkeys | Issue: Invalid hotkey token (example: `WIN`) in settings caused startup panic in `HotkeyManager::new`. | Impact: Tauri runtime crashed at launch with exit code 101. | Fix applied: Added `WIN`/`WINDOWS` alias handling and fallback to default hotkeys on invalid config during startup. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 26.
- 2026-02-11 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Cross-Phase Review | Issue: Current branch validation state regressed from documented claims (`npm run test -- --run` failing `src/App.test.tsx`; `npm run build` failing TS6133 in `src/hooks/useVoiceWave.ts`). | Impact: README/Phase III status overstates readiness and can mislead triage/handoff. | Fix applied: Logged documentation-evidence drift and reset expectations for next stabilization cycle. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 27.
- 2026-02-11 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Dev Experience Review | Issue: Direct desktop compile command in workspace path with spaces still fails (`windres` path parsing) while no-space wrapper strategy is required for reliable verification. | Impact: Contributors may conclude runtime is broken when the blocker is path/toolchain invocation shape. | Fix applied: Logged instruction-safety gap and enforced explicit no-space command policy. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 28.
- 2026-02-11 | Agent: Codex | Phase: I/II ASR Review | Issue: Phase benchmark/stability artifacts still come from fixture/scripted transcript paths rather than real microphone whisper.cpp quality measurements. | Impact: Product-quality confidence can be overstated despite poor real dictation output. | Fix applied: Logged quality-evidence gap for immediate stabilization planning. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 29.
- 2026-02-11 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Runtime QA | Issue: Live transcript artifacts showed special token leakage (`[BLANK_AUDIO]`) entering dictionary queue/history content. | Impact: User-facing transcript quality appears broken even when decode executes. | Fix applied: Logged transcript sanitization requirement before insertion/history pipelines. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 30.
- 2026-02-11 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Runtime QA | Issue: Active settings used a Bluetooth headset microphone profile with elevated VAD threshold during poor-transcription reports, without explicit runtime quality warning. | Impact: Users can remain on low-quality capture paths and perceive model/runtime failure. | Fix applied: Logged required microphone-quality warning and recovery UX gap for next patch cycle. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 31.
- 2026-02-11 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Documentation Rescue | Issue: `docs/PHASE1_IMPLEMENTATION.md` still claimed mock-only decode while Phase III/runtime docs reported whisper.cpp desktop integration. | Impact: Contradictory phase status could mislead rescue decisions and quality triage. | Fix applied: Rewrote Phase I/III implementation notes and README evidence to reflect current validated runtime truth. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 32.
- 2026-02-11 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Runtime Rescue | Issue: Home mic button returned immediate error when active model was not locally installed, forcing users into manual model triage before first dictation. | Impact: Primary dictation action felt broken despite recoverable runtime state. | Fix applied: Added automatic model readiness recovery (switch installed fallback or bootstrap `tiny.en`) and preflight microphone permission check in `useVoiceWave` run path. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 33.
- 2026-02-11 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Runtime UX Rescue | Issue: Mic interaction behavior drifted away from push-to-talk hold semantics, and short-release/no-speech paths surfaced a hard error state. | Impact: Users saw immediate red errors while attempting normal hold/release dictation flow. | Fix applied: Restored press-and-hold mic button behavior and handled no-speech release paths as non-error idle transitions in runtime controller. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 34.
- 2026-02-11 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Runtime UX Rescue | Issue: Insertion fallback outcomes were mapped to global error HUD state even when transcript was preserved, creating false-negative "broken" feedback. | Impact: Users saw red error state despite recoverable insertion behavior. | Fix applied: Reclassified non-success insertion results to non-fatal inserted feedback path and removed misleading auto-install status from error UI channel. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 35.
- 2026-02-11 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Runtime Transcript UX | Issue: Transcript UI consumed per-segment final events, causing final text to collapse to the last segment/word despite multi-segment speech. | Impact: Users saw word-by-word replacement and perceived incomplete sentence transcription. | Fix applied: Emitted cumulative partial transcript across segments and a single utterance-level final transcript event after segment aggregation. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 36.
- 2026-02-11 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Phase IV/V Prep Cleanup | Issue: Phase status docs diverged (`docs/PHASE_RECOVERY_PLAN.md` and `docs/PHASE2_IMPLEMENTATION.md` still described earlier blocked states despite validated rescue baseline). | Impact: Could mis-sequence Phase IV/V planning and create false blockers/assumptions. | Fix applied: Rebaselined recovery/phase docs, added Phase IV/V readiness docs, and introduced prep/gate scripts with explicit blocker reporting. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 37.
- 2026-02-11 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Phase IV Readiness Automation | Issue: `scripts/phase4/run-phase4-readiness.ps1` required a date-locked manual acceptance filename (`windows-manual-acceptance-2026-02-11.md`), creating false failures after the artifact date rolls. | Impact: Phase IV/Phase V prep status can fail despite valid new acceptance artifacts being present. | Fix applied: Switched script to resolve the latest `windows-manual-acceptance-*.md` artifact dynamically and synced readiness doc wording. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 38.
- 2026-02-11 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Phase IV Readiness Automation | Issue: Manual acceptance pass detection used a broad regex that could match instructional prose, creating false-positive gate results. | Impact: Phase IV readiness could show a pass for manual acceptance without any checklist rows actually marked as passed. | Fix applied: Anchored pass detection to checklist row format and adjusted instructions to avoid marker-like prose. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 39.
- 2026-02-11 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Phase IV Signing Hardening | Issue: Invalid-manifest-signature install path could leave orphan `.partial` model artifacts when checkpoint metadata was absent. | Impact: Tampered/invalid model attempts could leave stale files and inconsistent install-state hygiene. | Fix applied: Updated model-manager invalid-signature handling to quarantine/remove orphan partial artifacts even without checkpoint metadata; added evidence log with passing tamper/signature tests. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 40.
- 2026-02-11 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Phase IV Readiness Automation | Issue: Manual acceptance rows used markdown code formatting around pass/fail markers, causing parser false-negatives despite marked pass rows. | Impact: Phase IV gate could fail even when checklist intent was satisfied. | Fix applied: Normalized checklist rows to raw `[x] pass / [ ] fail` tokens in the acceptance artifact and re-ran gate. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 41.
- 2026-02-11 | Agent: Codex | Phase: V Build Verification | Issue: `npm run tauri:build` failed during bundle step with `Couldn't find a .ico icon` because `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` had `"bundle.icon": []` while bundling was active. | Impact: Windows release packaging was blocked even though compile/test/reliability gates were green. | Fix applied: Updated `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` to include `icons/icon.ico` in `bundle.icon` and re-ran `tauri:build`. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 42.
- 2026-02-11 | Agent: Codex | Phase: V Push-to-Talk Reliability | Issue: Microphone capture timeout path could transition to transcript before push-to-talk release because timeout handling auto-finished after speech/silence windows. | Impact: Users saw transcribing begin while still holding the push-to-talk keys. | Fix applied: Updated `src-tauri/src/audio/mod.rs` timeout logic to keep listening after speech until explicit stop/release (or max utterance cap), and added a regression test for release-tail capture behavior. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 43.
- 2026-02-11 | Agent: Codex | Phase: V Push-to-Talk Hotkey Runtime | Issue: Windows hotkey monitor awaited `trigger_hotkey_action` inline; push-to-talk press blocked the polling loop during active capture, so release edges were delayed/missed. Browser key defaults also caused in-app scroll jumps during shortcut use. | Impact: Dictation could stay listening after release and UI scrolled unexpectedly to lower sections while dictating. | Fix applied: Dispatched hotkey actions via async spawned tasks in `src-tauri/src/state.rs` and added frontend combo-key suppression in `src/hooks/useVoiceWave.ts`. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rules 44 and 45.
- 2026-02-11 | Agent: Codex | Phase: V Push-to-Talk Race Fix | Issue: After async hotkey dispatch, stale `pressed` tasks could execute after key release and start dictation without a matching stop edge. | Impact: Single-word dictation could get stuck in listening until another manual stop action. | Fix applied: Added key-state revalidation inside `trigger_hotkey_action` pressed branch before `start_dictation` in `src-tauri/src/state.rs`. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 46.
- 2026-02-11 | Agent: Codex | Phase: B Runtime Telemetry | Issue: Extending `DecodeTelemetry` with backend string fields while keeping `Copy` derive caused desktop-feature Rust compile failure (`E0204`) during validation. | Impact: `phase3:validate` failed and blocked readiness confirmation for the Phase B patch set. | Fix applied: Removed `Copy` derive from `DecodeTelemetry` and re-ran full `phase3:validate` successfully. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 47.
- 2026-02-11 | Agent: Codex | Phase: B GPU Tooling | Issue: Initial GPU readiness script used inline `if` expressions in command arguments, which is invalid in PowerShell and caused immediate script failure. | Impact: `phaseB:gpu:check` failed before reporting actual readiness state. | Fix applied: Rewrote inline conditions into explicit detail variables and re-ran readiness/sweep commands. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 48.
- 2026-02-11 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Speed Recovery | Issue: Incremental pre-release decode patch mixed `tauri::async_runtime::JoinHandle` and `tokio::task::JoinHandle`, causing desktop compile failure and invalid `is_finished` usage. | Impact: `phase3:validate` failed until runtime task handle usage was normalized. | Fix applied: Standardized the new incremental scheduler tasks on Tokio `JoinHandle`, updated diagnostics fixtures for additive fields, and re-ran all validation gates successfully. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 49.
- 2026-02-11 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Speed Recovery | Issue: Benchmark defaults used catalog-wide model IDs, so recommendation could fail or skew when some catalog models were not installed locally. | Impact: Per-machine model recommendation reliability dropped and default-model auto-selection could miss viable installed options. | Fix applied: Changed benchmark scope to installed models only, enriched recommendation ranking with observed reliability telemetry, and auto-applied recommendation only when the recommended model is installed. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 50.
- 2026-02-11 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Runtime Stabilization | Issue: `settings.json` written from PowerShell with UTF-8 BOM caused startup parse failure (`expected value at line 1 column 1`) in strict JSON load path. | Impact: `tauri:dev` failed at startup and app could not launch despite otherwise valid config content. | Fix applied: Updated settings loader to strip BOM/whitespace and return defaults for empty files; added BOM parsing regression test; rewrote local settings file without BOM. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 51.
- 2026-02-11 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Dev Experience Stabilization | Issue: Tauri wrappers auto-enabled CUDA whenever toolkit path existed, but GNU workflow lacked `cl.exe`, causing whisper.cpp CUDA CMake failure (`nvcc fatal: Cannot find compiler 'cl.exe'`). | Impact: `tauri:dev` and `tauri:build` failed on machines with CUDA toolkit but without MSVC build tools. | Fix applied: Added wrapper readiness guard to require `cl.exe` before enabling `whisper-cuda`; now auto-falls back to CPU unless forced. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 52.
- 2026-02-12 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Overlay UX | Issue: Floating pill appeared off-center on DPI-scaled displays and did not visibly react during early push-to-talk key hold because visuals depended only on later dictation state events. | Impact: User perceived flicker/legacy overlay behavior and a non-responsive pill despite hotkey input. | Fix applied: Added DPI-aware monitor-positioning with re-position on show in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` and immediate push-to-talk visual reaction in `src/components/FloatingPill.tsx`. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rules 53 and 54.
- 2026-02-12 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Overlay UX | Issue: Pill webview bridge could treat desktop runtime as unavailable because runtime detection only checked a narrow set of globals, causing silent event/invoke no-ops in the floating window. | Impact: No hotkey cue sounds and no state-driven animation updates despite backend activity. | Fix applied: Expanded runtime detection in `src/lib/tauri.ts`, added snapshot polling fallback and stable listener/sound hook behavior in `src/components/FloatingPill.tsx`. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 55.
- 2026-02-12 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Overlay UX | Issue: Waveform and transcribing loader used normal horizontal flow inside the pill, causing right-drift visual imbalance and off-center feedback. | Impact: Overlay looked misaligned even when window position was correct, reducing confidence in interaction quality. | Fix applied: Switched pill core to center-layered grid composition in `src/pill.css`, centered spinner/wave rendering across states, and applied a small window x-nudge in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 56.
- 2026-02-12 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Hotkey UX Stabilization | Issue: Default push-to-talk binding used `Ctrl+Alt+Space`, which can collide with external global launch bars (user observed random external bar popups during dictation key presses). | Impact: Perceived random UI interruptions and unreliable push-to-talk experience despite VoiceWave running correctly. | Fix applied: Locked hotkeys to `Ctrl+Windows` (push-to-talk) + `Ctrl+Alt+X` (toggle) and enforced this pair in settings/runtime so collisions are avoided consistently. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 57.
- 2026-02-12 | Agent: Codex | Phase: UX Flicker Stabilization | Issue: Mic-level event stream updated root hook state on nearly every sample, causing visible page flicker while hotkey dictation was active. | Impact: UI looked unstable during press-to-talk even when transcription pipeline was functioning. | Fix applied: Added mic-level update throttling/delta gating in `src/hooks/useVoiceWave.ts` and reduced extra animation pressure in dashboard/pill transitions. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 58.
- 2026-02-12 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Audio UX Stabilization | Issue: Mic-level monitor autostarted at app/pill initialization, which kept some Bluetooth headsets in hands-free/communications mode and muffled system playback even when not dictating. | Impact: Background laptop audio quality degraded while VoiceWave was open, reducing usability despite transcription being idle. | Fix applied: Moved monitor lifecycle to dictation lifecycle in `src-tauri/src/state.rs`, removed idle autostarts in `src/hooks/useVoiceWave.ts` and `src/components/FloatingPill.tsx`, and kept monitor restart on device change only while actively listening. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 59.
- 2026-02-12 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Cross-App Insertion Reliability | Issue: Browser rich-text editors (notably Google AI Studio) can produce unstable/weird inserted output when direct per-character key injection is used or clipboard is restored too quickly after Ctrl+V. | Impact: Transcript appeared correct in some apps (VS Code) but degraded or mutated in AI Studio-style web inputs, creating a false impression of model failure. | Fix applied: Updated insertion policy in `src-tauri/src/insertion/mod.rs` to auto-prefer clipboard for browser/AI-Studio/unknown targets and increased clipboard restore delay for those targets; added deterministic tests for Google AI Studio and unknown-target clipboard preference. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 60.
- 2026-02-12 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Hotkey Reliability Stabilization | Issue: Modifier-only push-to-talk polling (`Ctrl+Windows`) could emit a false release immediately after press due transient Windows key-state sampling jitter, causing dictation to start and stop instantly. | Impact: Users could not reliably hold-to-talk with locked hotkey pair because sessions terminated almost immediately. | Fix applied: Added multi-sample debounce on push-to-talk press/release edges in `src-tauri/src/state.rs` monitor loop (press requires consecutive down samples, release requires consecutive up samples). | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 61.
- 2026-02-12 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Hotkey Reliability Stabilization | Issue: Initial debounce window still allowed occasional immediate stop on some Windows keyboard stacks because release confirmation was too short for modifier-only combos. | Impact: Dictation could still flash `listening` then stop even while user continued holding keys. | Fix applied: Increased release confirmation window in `src-tauri/src/state.rs` hotkey polling loop to require a longer consecutive-up streak before emitting release. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 61.
- 2026-02-12 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Hotkey Reliability Stabilization | Issue: Some drivers intermittently report `SUPER` as up while still physically held, so strict combo-state release detection could still stop active hold-to-talk sessions. | Impact: Push-to-talk could still terminate mid-hold on affected systems despite debounce. | Fix applied: Added modifier-guard release logic in `src-tauri/src/state.rs` so release countdown runs only when both required guard modifiers are actually up. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 61.
- 2026-02-13 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Runtime Reliability Stabilization | Issue: Push-to-talk release events could stop sessions launched from the in-app mic button, and Windows modifier sampling could still jitter on generic modifier VK checks. | Impact: Dictation appeared to start and stop instantly for both hotkey and in-app press-and-hold flows. | Fix applied: Scoped push-release stopping to push-origin sessions in `src-tauri/src/state.rs`, hardened modifier detection to include left/right control keys in `src-tauri/src/hotkey/mod.rs` and state guard logic, and switched dashboard hold button to pointer-capture lifecycle in `src/prototype/components/Dashboard.tsx`. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rules 62 and 63.
- 2026-02-13 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Runtime Reliability Stabilization | Issue: `start_dictation` could overwrite `active_session` before duplicate-start rejection, and normal dictation also opened a second mic-level monitor stream in parallel with capture. | Impact: Session ownership metadata could desynchronize under concurrent start edges, and some Windows audio stacks could exhibit unstable/short-lived captures with dual input streams. | Fix applied: Reordered start flow to claim cancellation token before writing `active_session`, and moved mic-level emission into the capture observer path so normal dictation uses one input stream. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rules 64 and 65.
- 2026-02-13 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Runtime Reliability Stabilization | Issue: Even with release guards, an early stop signal propagated into capture could still terminate a fresh session before speech buffering stabilized. | Impact: Users perceived a millisecond listen-then-stop behavior on some systems. | Fix applied: Added early stop-signal debounce in `src-tauri/src/audio/mod.rs` and runtime-side minimum-stop guard in `src-tauri/src/state.rs` to ignore premature stop requests. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 66.
- 2026-02-13 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Quality Guard Hardening | Issue: Recent speed-focused tuning regressed perceived transcript quality because quality-floor checks were not fully enforced in automated validation. | Impact: Accuracy could drift between iterations even when test/build stayed green. | Fix applied: Tightened audio conditioning safety, removed legacy forced-fast decode override, expanded Rust quality guard tests, and wired those tests into `scripts/phase3/run-phase3-validation.ps1`. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 67.
- 2026-02-13 | Agent: Codex | Phase: ASR Recovery | Issue: Faster-Whisper runtime path could lose most of an utterance when strict capture-side VAD produced sparse segments, causing severe real-mic quality drops despite stable decode execution. | Impact: Multi-second dictation attempts could be reduced to sub-second audio for inference, leading to missing words and unusable transcripts. | Fix applied: Added contiguous-capture preservation mode for Faster-Whisper in `src-tauri/src/audio/mod.rs`, wired it in `src-tauri/src/state.rs`, added decode-side audio conditioning for Faster-Whisper in `src-tauri/src/inference/mod.rs`, and added a capture regression test. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 68.
- 2026-02-13 | Agent: Codex | Phase: ASR Recovery | Issue: New headset/decode-mode floor wiring emitted `audio_quality` by value before reuse, causing desktop-feature Rust compile failure (`E0382 use of moved value`). | Impact: `phase3:validate` desktop compile gate failed until ownership bug was corrected. | Fix applied: Switched `voicewave://audio-quality` emit call to use `audio_quality.clone()` in `src-tauri/src/state.rs` and re-ran validation gates. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 69.
- 2026-02-13 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Latency Telemetry Stabilization | Issue: `post_ms` timer started before final decode completed, so decode cost was double-counted in `release_to_final_ms` and decode-policy telemetry signals. | Impact: Live speed metrics were inflated and could mislead automatic decode-mode policy decisions despite correct transcript output. | Fix applied: Moved `post_ms` start boundary to after final transcript decode in `src-tauri/src/state.rs` and re-ran `phase3:validate` plus live diagnostics checks. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 70.
- 2026-02-13 | Agent: Codex | Phase: ASR Measurement Clarity | Issue: Live report `success rate` was interpreted as transcript accuracy, but runtime records currently map `success` to insertion/pipeline completion. | Impact: Quality confidence could be overstated even when users still hear/see transcription mistakes. | Fix applied: Added ASR integrity telemetry fields in diagnostics/state and relabeled live report output to explicitly describe pipeline success vs transcript integrity. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 71.
- 2026-02-13 | Agent: Codex | Phase: ASR Measurement Clarity | Issue: Initial ASR-integrity instrumentation in `src-tauri/src/state.rs` moved `finalize_text` into merge flow before later integrity computation, causing desktop compile failure (`E0382`). | Impact: `phase3:validate` failed until ownership fix landed. | Fix applied: Preserved `finalize_text` for metrics by cloning in the non-merge branch and reran validation gates. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 72.
- 2026-02-13 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Hotkey Cue Reliability | Issue: Hotkey cue path mixed OS beep APIs and pill WebAudio synthesis, leading to compile churn and unreliable/no-audio behavior on some desktop runs. | Impact: Press/release feedback could be silent or non-distinct during push-to-talk despite hotkey events firing. | Fix applied: Switched to app-owned WAV cues played via Windows `PlaySoundA` from runtime events and removed pill WebAudio cue playback path; revalidated with `phase3:validate`. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 73.
- 2026-02-14 | Agent: Codex | Phase: UI Popup Refinement | Issue: Popup conversion introduced duplicate visible labels (`Settings`, `Style`) between sidebar nav and modal titles, and existing global text assertions in `src/App.test.tsx` became ambiguous. | Impact: Frontend test suite failed despite correct runtime behavior, increasing regression noise. | Fix applied: Scoped popup assertions to named dialogs using `getByRole('dialog', { name })` and `within(dialog)` in `src/App.test.tsx`; reran tests/build successfully. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 74.
- 2026-02-14 | Agent: Codex | Phase: UI Popup Animation Refinement | Issue: Initial popup animation interpretation added lateral settle/overshoot, which felt like side-travel/shake instead of a purely smooth bottom-left-to-center rise. | Impact: Visual motion diverged from requested premium feel. | Fix applied: Replaced animation with a single-path directional entrance (no overshoot) in `src/styles.css` and retained reduced-motion fallback. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 75.
- 2026-02-14 | Agent: Codex | Phase: Pill Visual Refinement | Issue: Brand gradient styling was initially applied partly inside the pill surface and produced a hard-edged top artifact, diverging from the requested outside-only glow. | Impact: Pill looked less premium and less faithful to requested visual direction. | Fix applied: Restored black pill interior, moved brand color to outside-only radial aura, and softened glow edges in `src/pill.css`; revalidated test/build. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 76.
- 2026-02-16 | Agent: Codex | Phase: B Speed Stabilization | Issue: Live latency telemetry still mixed insertion time into `post_ms`, so `release_to_final` was effectively tracking inserted latency and could overstate ASR decode speed regressions. | Impact: Runtime policy tuning and report interpretation could target the wrong bottleneck (decode vs insertion), slowing optimization cycles. | Fix applied: Separated timing boundaries in `src-tauri/src/state.rs` so `post_ms` excludes insertion, added explicit `release_to_inserted_ms` usage in reporting, and updated live report script to show both final vs inserted latencies plus decode-only percentiles. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 70.
- 2026-02-16 | Agent: Codex | Phase: B GPU Stabilization | Issue: Faster-Whisper CUDA path could appear available in readiness checks yet fail at runtime decode, causing long first-utterance delays before CPU fallback. | Impact: Users perceived hanging/crash behavior and inconsistent latency after enabling auto-GPU. | Fix applied: Switched default FW GPU compute type to stability-first `int8` and added persistent CPU-preferred marker on CUDA decode fallback in `src-tauri/src/inference/faster_whisper.rs` (force-GPU override preserved). | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 77.
- 2026-02-16 | Agent: Codex | Phase: B GPU Diagnostics | Issue: Phase B GPU readiness script passed on CUDA toolkit/link checks but missed CTranslate2 runtime DLL compatibility, producing a false "GPU ready" signal while decode failed (`cublas64_12.dll` missing). | Impact: Debug cycle time increased and users experienced long fallback delays before discovering environment mismatch. | Fix applied: Added runtime DLL compatibility check to `scripts/phaseB/run-phaseB-gpu-readiness.ps1` and validated the expected fail signal on this machine. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 78.
- 2026-02-16 | Agent: Codex | Phase: B GPU Diagnostics | Issue: After adding runtime DLL checks, readiness still false-failed on machines using project-scoped CUDA runtime wheels because the script only looked in toolkit `bin` and not `.venv-faster-whisper` NVIDIA package bins. | Impact: GPU could be fully functional while readiness reported failure, creating avoidable confusion and delaying validation. | Fix applied: Updated `scripts/phaseB/run-phaseB-gpu-readiness.ps1` to resolve candidate DLL paths from both CUDA toolkit and Faster-Whisper venv NVIDIA bins; re-ran readiness to confirm PASS with package-provided `cublas64_12.dll`. | Prevention rule added: Quality and Safety rule 79.

## 8) Decision Log

- 2026-02-10 | Phase: I | Decision: Implemented a mock local inference adapter first (cancellable + partial streaming contract) before wiring whisper.cpp runtime. | Rationale: De-risks event/state architecture and UI integration early while preserving Phase I boundaries. | Revisit Trigger: Replace with whisper.cpp-backed decoder inside Phase I before exit criteria signoff.
- 2026-02-10 | Phase: I | Decision: Adopted dual-source dictation entry (`microphone` default, `fixture` deterministic fallback) under a single `start_dictation(mode)` contract. | Rationale: Enables real mic path for Phase I goals while keeping deterministic testability for CI/stability loops. | Revisit Trigger: Remove or hide fixture mode from production UX once full on-device inference confidence is established.
- 2026-02-10 | Phase: I | Decision: Added Phase I validation harness (`phase1_harness`) and CI Rust test gate on Windows. | Rationale: Exit criteria require latency/stability evidence and Rust regressions must fail CI. | Revisit Trigger: Replace harness-derived fixture metrics with device-lab microphone + whisper.cpp benchmark reports.
- 2026-02-10 | Phase: I | Decision: Apply temporary Windows-only implementation and validation scope due available hardware constraints. | Rationale: Keeps progress focused and prevents blocked macOS-only work while still preserving v1 cross-platform target in product plan. | Revisit Trigger: Resume macOS Phase I parity when macOS hardware is available.
- 2026-02-10 | Phase: II | Decision: Added explicit hotkey/insertion/permission command-event surfaces while preserving existing Phase I `start_dictation(mode)` + `cancel_dictation` contracts. | Rationale: Enables parallel Phase III work with stable integration interfaces and deterministic state/event behavior. | Revisit Trigger: Replace in-app keyboard hotkey bridge with OS-global registration when dedicated global shortcut plugin path is approved.
- 2026-02-10 | Phase: II | Decision: Insertion engine uses deterministic fallback ordering (`direct -> clipboardPaste -> clipboardOnly -> historyFallback`) with undo token and recent insertion ring buffer. | Rationale: Prioritizes reliability and data safety over platform-specific insertion optimization in this cycle. | Revisit Trigger: Upgrade direct insertion backend per supported-app matrix once platform-specific adapters are ready.
- 2026-02-10 | Phase: III | Decision: Kept all Phase II command/event contracts stable and added Phase III capabilities as additive command surfaces only. | Rationale: Preserves integration safety for parallel agents while enabling model manager, benchmark, retention, and dictionary queue workflows. | Revisit Trigger: Consider command consolidation only after Phase III freeze and shared RFC update.
- 2026-02-10 | Phase: III | Decision: Implemented left-nav Phase III sections (`models`, `sessions`, `dictionary`, `settings`) using the existing prototype shell with runtime-backed actions and web fallback simulation. | Rationale: Delivers functional parity with current app structure without visual churn or policy drift from local-only posture. | Revisit Trigger: Revisit panel composition when Phase IV adds diagnostics/release controls.
- 2026-02-10 | Phase: I-III Runtime | Decision: Vendor-patched `whisper-rs` + `whisper-rs-sys` for Windows GNU (`libclang` bindings + verbatim `ggml*.a` linking) to keep whisper.cpp runtime compile-valid in this workspace/toolchain. | Rationale: Upstream defaults did not reliably link GNU static archives in this environment, blocking mandatory desktop-feature validation. | Revisit Trigger: Remove local vendor patches when upstream crates provide a stable Windows GNU path without local overrides.
- 2026-02-11 | Phase: Runtime QA | Decision: Added an in-app audio chunk quality diagnostic surface (`run_audio_quality_diagnostic` command + `voicewave://audio-quality` event + Home panel report) to evaluate real captured mic chunks before decode quality tuning. | Rationale: Transcript symptoms alone are insufficient to isolate capture-vs-model failures; chunk-level metrics (RMS/clipping/low-energy/SNR proxy) create actionable root-cause visibility. | Revisit Trigger: Replace proxy heuristics with calibrated device-lab thresholds and persisted diagnostics artifacts during Phase IV/V hardening.
- 2026-02-11 | Phase: IV | Decision: Defer the 30-minute sustained battery gate from active implementation flow to Phase VI pre-GA hardening with an explicit marker file (`docs/phase4/evidence/battery-deferment.md`). | Rationale: Product owner prioritized shipping core dictation reliability before long-run battery capture; deferment keeps gate explicit and auditable without blocking stabilization work. | Revisit Trigger: Before GA release candidate signoff, run `npm run phase1:battery` and update artifact to `duration_minutes >= 30.0`.
- 2026-02-11 | Phase: V | Decision: Added additive diagnostics command surface (`get_diagnostics_status`, `set_diagnostics_opt_in`, `export_diagnostics_bundle`) and additive latency payload fields (`watchdogRecovered`, `segmentsCaptured`, `releaseStopDetectedAtUtcMs`) without renaming existing contracts. | Rationale: Phase V reliability operations require explicit opt-in diagnostics export and watchdog visibility while preserving interface stability for current frontend/runtime flows. | Revisit Trigger: Revisit payload/command consolidation only after Phase V exit gate and shared RFC update.
- 2026-02-11 | Phase: A | Decision: Added a persistent CPU inference runtime pool with model prewarm + runtime auto decode-policy (`balanced`/`fast`) while keeping user-facing settings simple and contract-compatible. | Rationale: `small.en` latency was dominated by per-utterance context initialization and manual mode selection created UX confusion; runtime-managed pooling/policy improves warm-path speed without exposing extra knobs. | Revisit Trigger: Reassess policy thresholds and pool sizing after collecting real Phase A artifact series with cache-hit and failure-rate telemetry.
- 2026-02-11 | Phase: B | Decision: Added runtime-managed backend selection (prefer CUDA for `small.en` and above when compiled/toolkit-available, with automatic CPU fallback) and additive latency telemetry fields (`backendRequested`, `backendUsed`, `backendFallback`). | Rationale: Small-model latency requires hardware acceleration where available, but v1 UX must stay zero-config and resilient on non-GPU setups. | Revisit Trigger: After collecting Phase B live sweeps, decide whether to keep heuristic model gating or move to fully metrics-driven backend switching.
- 2026-02-16 | Phase: B | Decision: Faster-Whisper worker now resolves backend at runtime (`auto`/`cuda`/`cpu`) with safety-first CPU fallback and reports backend choice in decode telemetry. | Rationale: Faster-Whisper path previously stayed CPU-pinned in practice despite existing backend telemetry infrastructure, limiting attainable short-utterance latency on RTX-class hardware. | Revisit Trigger: After fresh live FW runs on GPU and CPU-only machines, tune compute-type defaults and fallback lock thresholds if instability or quality drift appears.
- 2026-02-16 | Phase: B | Decision: Favor project-scoped CUDA runtime dependencies for Faster-Whisper (`nvidia-cublas-cu12`/`nvidia-cudnn-cu12`/`nvidia-cuda-runtime-cu12`) and prepend venv NVIDIA `bin` paths when spawning the worker. | Rationale: System CUDA major-version drift (CUDA 13 toolkit with CTranslate2 expecting CUDA 12 runtime DLLs) can break decode despite GPU availability; venv-scoped runtime DLLs provide safer, reversible compatibility without OS-wide toolkit churn. | Revisit Trigger: Reassess when CTranslate2 Windows builds natively target newer CUDA majors used by default toolkit installs.
