# VoiceWave Prototype Reference

This directory is a **frontend reference artifact only**.

## Important

1. It is not part of the production runtime path.
2. Do not wire cloud API keys or Gemini flows from this folder into v1 runtime.
3. Production VoiceWave is local-only and uses whisper.cpp in the Tauri/Rust runtime.

## Usage

1. Use this folder only to compare layout and UI structure.
2. Keep implementation work in the main app paths under `src/` and `src-tauri/`.
